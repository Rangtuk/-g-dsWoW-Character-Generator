Random World of Warcraft character generator by Maloka (J.C.) - WIP  
Original the Program (nothing personnel kids, but this ain't yours to take!)  
I'm working on this project that no one asked for in between actual job tasks in an effort to improve my coding skill and also because I can.  

Any and all feedback is appreciated!  

Changes in the making:  
  Adding the option to include/uninclude allied races, current design would be difficult and its not high on my priority list.  
  Beautification of UI now that the basic program works (pictures, custom font, etc.)  
  Restructuring of actual code, definitely feel it can be trimmed/improved, this goes in hand with my overarching goal of skill improvement  
  Actually having a database instead of crazy big arrays!   
  I know I know, but when working on this I typically dont have internet and keep putting off downloading SQL when I do
